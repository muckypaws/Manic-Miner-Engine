The Game:

The following is taken from the Bug Byte inlay :-

Miner Willy, while prospecting down Surbiton way, stumbles upon an
ancient, long forgotten mine-shaft. On further exploration, he finds
evidence of a lost civilisation far superior to our own, which used
automatons to dig deep into the Earth's core to supply the essential raw
materials for their advanced industry. After centuries of peace and
prosperity, the civilisation was torn apart by war, and lapsed into a long
dark age, abandoning their industry and machines. Nobody, however,
thought to tell the mine robots to stop working, and through countless
aeons they had steadily accumulated a huge stockpile of valuable metals
and minerals, and Miner Willy realises that he now has the opportunity to
make his fortune by finding the underground store. Can YOU take the
challenge and guide Willy through the underground caverns to the 
surface and riches. In order to move to the next chamber, you must 
collect all the flashing keys in the room while avoiding nasties like
POISONOUS PANSIES and SPIDERS and SLIME and worst of all, MANIC MINING
ROBOTS. When you have all the keys, you can enter the portal which will
now be flashing. The game ends when you have been "got" or fallen
heavily three times.

Manic Miner was one of my all time favourite ZX Spectrum Games back in the '80s

and jump through it to get to the next level.

ABOUT The Additional 20 Levels and Copyright Information.

'TALES FROM A PARALLEL UNIVERSE' (Taken from Andy's ReadME FILE)
(excerpts from Blood's 'Tales From a Parallel Universe' docs)

Designed by the infamous BLOOD! (ltonks@iclretail.icl.com)
(c)1996 Cheese Freak Software

INSTRUCTIONS

It is rumoured that there are an infinite number of parallel universes
where every possibility is played out. Things in these other dimensions
may be very similar to our own reality, but subtly different because of
certain decisions which were taken differently.

Miner Willy is no exception to this rule. Previously, thousands of
Speccy owners had thrilled to his adventures in his battle to escape the
Manic Mining machines, but now Cheese Freak Software brings you the
escapades of ANOTHER Miner Willy from a parallel universe! Just like his
counterpart in this reality, Willy has fallen into a mine packed with
dangers and must escape from 20 lethal caverns in order to locate the
untold treasures of an ancient civilisation. However, in this universe
things are subtly different..... Can Miner Willy emulate the antics of
his trans-dimensional counterpart, or are the Speccy owners of the other
universe doomed to a life with no Jet Set Willy?

FOR THE EASILY FOOLED

In case you hadn't noticed, this is a version of Manic Miner which I
have edited with the Manic Miner Editor to produce a very different
game! All 20 screens have been replaced (and the scrolly message!) and
should prove a new challenge for MM addicts. I can't pretend that my
screens are as good as Matt Smith's originals, but I GUARANTEE that
they're much better than the very crap 'Manic Miner 2' snapshot which
has been doing the rounds on the Internet.

I'm not asking for anything for this - it's free, just play it and enjoy
it. 

Regards,
Blood.

p.s. The screens are as follows. If you want to take a peek at 'em, use
the level skip cheat or watch the demonstration......

 1. Slightly to One Side Cavern
 2. Brass Penguins?
 3. Bernard Matthews' Personal Hell
 4. Sealed with a Glasgow Kiss
 5. Future Echoes
 6. Pac Up Your Troubles
 7. Altar of 7th Day Advent Hoppists
 8. Alan Sugar's Take-Over Bid
 9. Perils of a Bad-Hair Day
10. Dr. Jones WOOD Believe This!
11. Revenge of Brian's Phone Bill! (dedicated to Brian 'No Binaries!' Gaff)
12. Alan Sugar must DIE!
13. The 'Difficult to Edit' Cavern
14. Crashing More Often Than a ZX81!
15. Matthew Smith's Unpaid Royalties
16. Zucchini! Or Something.... (dedicated to the hard working YS team)
17. Farmer Barleymow's DDT Store
18. Eye o' Oktup (dedicated to 'dat ole looney...bwah!)
19. Warp Core Breach
20. Join the Jet Set (with apologies to Richard Hallas!)
