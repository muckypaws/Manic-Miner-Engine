## Install Instructions

`cd ~/ManicMiner`
`chmod +x RunMeFirst.sh`

For the first time after downloading the files you'll need to run 

`./RunMeFirst.sh`

This will require root privileges to change ownership of the files to the current user.
It will check you have the relevant packages installed on your system.  If they're 
not installed, will automatically install them.

When complete, it will automatically run the game.

After the initial Installation, you simply use 

`cd ~/ManicMiner`
`./ManicMiner.sh`

The script will automatically select the correct version for 32 or 64 bit Linux.
