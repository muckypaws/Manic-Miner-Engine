Manic4Noob.tap tape format conversion with loader kindly done by Lee Price. This is the same game as Manic-4-Noobs (Final).

Will keep this short as know most peeps scan-read these :)

Detailed description of project will (eventually) appear on:

bobstuff.net

(Very much a work-in-progress website).

Manic Miner was created by the genius: Matthew Smith.

Copyright ©: BugByte Ltd. 1983, Software Projects 1983.

Additional Routines: "Drop Splat" sound effect based on code by Brendan Alford.

Would like to thank Jim Bagley and Daniel A. Nagy for help with routines that I've either

butchered beyond recognition or have earmarked for "Manic-minors" :)

Other routines are my own work, and a bit clunky as only recently getting back into Z80 m/c.

If you wish to use them please let me know as I might have a more streamlined version,

and maybe think about giving me a credit, poured blood, sweat and tears into every byte :)

A number of people have offered encouragement and pointed me in the right direction.

So would hate to single out anyone in particular, but, Andy Ford has been a great help

when I couldn't see the bytes for the bits.

For my own taste, on Windows 10, like how the game...

...looks using: Spectaculator,
https://www.spectaculator.com/

...plays using Fuse,
http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/

...sounds using ZXSpin (but only with echo/reverb on).
https://www.zophar.net/sinclair.html

These emulators have a number of settings to adjust the display and sound,

please tweak them to your own personal taste :)
