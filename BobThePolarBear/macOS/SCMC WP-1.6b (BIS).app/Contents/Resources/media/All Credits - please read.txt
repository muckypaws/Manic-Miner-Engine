Consider the lack of playing instructions part of the challenge :o)

Each music version contains all three pieces of music detailed above.
You can just download one version and change the following:

Locate the file: SCMC WP-16b/media/config/Level1Data.txt
Near the top of the file you will see the entry below (or something similar):

; Remove the semicolon AND move to top of list to play.
[LevelMusic]
Benny Hill Theme.ogg
;William Tell Remix.ogg

To make Back In Summer the default tune, change it to:

; Remove the semicolon AND move to top of list to play.
[LevelMusic]
Back In Summer.ogg

You can add your own music in .ogg format by adding it to the following folder:
