Main Changes
============

All platforms, conveyors, crumble, walls and nasties are invisible but are still functional.

Horizontal Baddies are invisible when travelling from right-to-left but can still kill.

A couple of extra visible hazards have been added.

Six keys to collect each cavern rather than five.

Enjoy! :O)
