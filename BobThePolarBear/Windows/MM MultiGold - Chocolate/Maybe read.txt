This is a tribute to the classic Manic Miner by Matthew Smith, and the very short audio "snippets"
have been selected to kindle nostalgia in those old enough to remember the originals release.
It is hoped that players might seek-out and re-enjoy some of the works connect to these snippets.

For taking the time to read this, a little bonus. There is a hidden block and additional music snippets
in the first cavern, and another hidden snippet somewhere towards the middle of the game.
Please do not share this info on forums/groups, it's meant to be a secret. If you want to mention/trigger them
while making a playthrough video, that's up to you.

Oh, instructions and screen-shots folder will be added at some point.
