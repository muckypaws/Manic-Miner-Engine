# Manic Miner for Windows

Created by Jason Brooks for Wonkypix.com and Muckypaws.com 

This software is provided as a free download.

Download the ManicMinerV17a to your Windows Device, and unzip to a location of your choice.

There are two versions of the executable provided. 

`ManicMinerV17OpenGL.exe`
`ManicMinerV17Vulkan.exe`

I recommend the OpenGL version for older and legacy hardware.

If you have a modern graphics card, the Vulkan version may work better for you.
